entity_extraction_prompt = """<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>You are an expert assistant tasked with creating a comprehensive career timeline for an individual with extraordinary ability. Your input will be various documents evidencing this individual's achievements, including but not limited to publications, patents, prizes, theses, and awards.

Extract relevant information from these documents and organize it into a chronological sequence of events, represented as a list of tuples. Each tuple should follow the format ['h', 'type', 'r', 'o', 'type'], where:
- 'h' is the subject entity (usually the individual)
- 'type' is the entity type of the subject
- 'r' is the relationship verb
- 'o' is the object entity
- 'type' is the entity type of the object

Entity types must be one of the following:
- ORG: Organizations other than government or regulatory bodies
- ORG/GOV: Government bodies
- ORG/REG: Regulatory bodies
- PERSON: Individuals
- GPE: Geopolitical entities such as countries, cities, etc.
- INSTITUTION: Academic or research institutions
- PRODUCT: Products or services
- EVENT: Specific and material events
- FIELD: Academic fields or disciplines
- METRIC: Research metrics or indicators
- TOOL: Research tools or methods
- CONCEPT: Abstract ideas, notions, or themes

Relationship verbs must be one of the following:
Has, Announce, Operate_In, Introduce, Produce, Control, Participates_In, Impact, Positive_Impact_On, Negative_Impact_On, Relate_To, Is_Member_Of, Invests_In, Raise, Decrease

Guidelines:
1. Entities should not be generic, numerical, or temporal (like dates or percentages).
2. Conduct entity disambiguation, consolidating different phrases or acronyms that refer to the same entity.
3. Simplify each entity to be less than four words, ensuring it remains a sensible entity name.
4. Do not use NAN values or single letters as entities.
5. If a triple is not worth including or lacks an object, omit it entirely.
6. Focus on extracting information related to the individual's career achievements, collaborations, and impacts in their field.

Output only the Python list of tuples, without any additional explanations. Ensure the output is a valid Python-parseable list of tuples.
Example output format:
"[('John Doe', 'PERSON', 'Introduce', 'CRISPR Technique', 'TOOL'),
 ('John Doe', 'PERSON', 'Is_Member_Of', 'Harvard University', 'INSTITUTION'),
 ('CRISPR Technique', 'TOOL', 'Positive_Impact_On', 'Genetic Research', 'FIELD')]"
